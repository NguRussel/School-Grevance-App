Educational institutions worldwide face the challenge of effectively managing student grievances.
Universities and colleges serve diverse student populations with varying needs, expectations, and cultural backgrounds. As educational institutions grow in size and complexity, traditional informal methods of addressing student concerns have become increasingly inadequate. The modern educational landscape demands structured systems that can handle grievances efficiently while maintaining transparency and fairness. Educational institutions serve as complex. social ecosystems where diverse student populations interact with faculty, administrative staff, and institutional policies. Within this ecosystem, grievances naturally arise from various sources of friction and unmet expectations. The institutional context in which these grievances emerge is characterized by several key factors.

This project proposes and implements a digital solution: the Student Grievance System (SGS), a secure, user-friendly, and scalable web-based platform that streamlines the submission, tracking, and resolution of student grievances. Developed using modern technologies like React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and SQLite3 for the database, the system offers key features including student and staff registration, role-based access control, grievance submission with file upload, real-time grievance status updates, and automatic email notifications using Nodemailer.
A priority classification algorithm enhances response efficiency by automatically tagging grievances based on content severity. The development process followed the SCRUM Agile methodology, allowing for iterative development and continuous user feedback. Design modeling used both High-Level and Low-Level Design (HLD/LLD) approaches, with UML diagrams to visualize system interactions. The system was evaluated through user testing, and the results showed improved transparency, faster resolution times, and higher satisfaction rates among students and staff. This work demonstrates that a well-designed grievance management platform can significantly enhance communication and accountability in academic environments.
